# Sentient Artefact

An interactive multimedia experience that generates poetry from a scene and responds with light and sound. Built using Raspberry Pi and Arduino, the artefact combines AI with tactile and audio-reactive interaction.

---

## Components

The project consists of **two circuits**:
- **Circuit 01:** Powered by Raspberry Pi for AI interaction and poem generation.
- **Circuit 02:** Powered by Arduino for real-time audio-reactive lighting.

## ðŸ“· Circuit 01 â€“ Raspberry Pi System

### Raspberry Pi 4
A powerful SBC used for real-time tasks such as:
- Capturing images
- Generating poems via AI
- Playing audio output

> **Recommended:** Raspberry Pi 4 Desktop Kit for complete setup.

### Raspberry Pi Camera Module Rev 1.3
- 8MP Sony IMX219 sensor
- Captures high-quality images and HD video
- Connected via CSI ribbon cable

### Arcade Button (Chrome Silver Plated)
- Momentary switch triggering the interaction sequence
- Connected to GPIO pins
- Tactile and visually engaging

### Jumbo Blue LED
- Visual countdown indicator
- Blinks after button press to signal processing
- Connected through GPIO with a current-limiting resistor

### AYL Mini Speaker
- Compact, loud audio output
- Plays AI-generated poem via 3.5mm jack
- Rechargeable and portable

## ðŸ’¡ Circuit 02 â€“ Arduino System

### Arduino Uno
- Controls audio-reactive lighting
- Processes analog signals from microphone
- Runs lighting animations in sync with poem audio

### Electret Microphone Amplifier (MAX9814)
- Captures real-time sound levels with AGC
- Outputs analog volume signal to Arduino

### NeoPixel Sticks
- 8x5050 RGB LEDs per stick
- 6 sticks used for dynamic lighting effects
- Controlled via single digital pin using WS2812 protocol

### On-Off Rocker Switch
- Manual power control for Circuit 02
- Ensures safe power management

### Power Banks
- Ensures full mobility
- One power bank for Pi (5V/3A)
- One for Arduino + LEDs to avoid power fluctuation
